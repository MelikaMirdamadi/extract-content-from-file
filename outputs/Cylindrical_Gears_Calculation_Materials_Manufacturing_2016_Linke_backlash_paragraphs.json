      "full_paragraph": "With rack-type cutters, hobs and pinion-type cutters, on the real gear the backlash allowance has an effect on the root diameter df and thus also on the tip clearance c. In the case of pinion-type cutters, these quantities are also somewhat influenced by the profile shift and number of teeth, of both the gear being produced as well as the tool, since in the case of a pairing with a finite number of teeth no proportionality exists between thickness variation and centre distance variation (here shaper cutter - workpiece). A significant change of the root diameter can also occur because of dimensional deviations during heat treatment (e.g., case hardening). The tooth root curvature radius N f (size and course) that is actually produced is also dependent on the number of teeth z and the profile shift coefficient x (Section 2.3.3). If the tool tip radius is Na0 (e.g., Na0 = 0.25m n or 0.38 mn), tooth root curvature radii of Nf ≥ Na0 are produced on the gear in the case of rack-type cutters or hobs. If one uses pinion-type cutters, on the other hand, which do not always have a special tip radius, if an unfavourable profile shift occurs, then tooth root curvature radii Nf < 0.25 mn are possible, as opposed to the basic rack. This is a fact which is often ignored. In the calculation of load capacity (stress concentration effect), if one carefully observes the fillet being produced, potentially unfavourable effects will not remain unnoticed.",

Usually c* = 0.25 is given preference. In exceptional cases, c* is an amount up to more than 0.4 (as in the case of a protuberance). In accordance with ISO 53 (DIN 867), haP/mn = 1 applies for the standardised basic rack. Since the tooth tip and the tooth root are not directly involved in flank contact, these quantities are usually allowed a larger range of tolerance in the production drawings and – if the tip diameter d a is not meant as technological basis – the tip cylinder envelope surface is only roughly machined. The tolerance value for d a is often h9 (or H9 respectively) and rougher. The root diameter df is often not specified because it is automatically generated during the manufacturing process, for example hobbing. In the case of larger gears, through heat treatment (case hardening in particular), considerable “growth” or “shrinkage” can occur, which makes an in clusion of this diameter ( d f) in the design, as a condition for dimensional control, recommendable. Other things that have an influence on the root diameter are the backlash allowances because they are usually considered by tool advance or retraction. Additionally, in the case of production using the shaper cutter, the root diameter is also dependent on the number of teeth and the profile shift of the shaper cutter and the workpiece. For helical gearing, the pressure angle Į t > Į = 20° with ȕ  0° results in an undercut limit that is shifted in the direction of the lower number of teeth (Table 2.1/6). If it is possible to approximate the tooth form of helical gearing using equivalent spur gearing (virtual spur gearing), it can be simpler to specify certain geometric quantities, especially for the calculation of load capacity, because there is one parameter less (the helix angle). The approxi-mation succeeds with the help of the curvature of the ellipse created on the plane normal to the tooth flanks (Figure 2.2/10). For this, first the reference cylinder is selected. The large half-axis A of the ellipse is A = d/(2cos ȕ) and the small half-axis B is B = d/2. The radius of curvature Nn = A2/B is in point C.",

This is equal to the hob tip height minus the distance ǻ h of the grinding tool to the tooth root surface; ǻh  hs (for h s refer to Figure 3.2/7). The form diameter thus derived must be greater than the usable circle diameter. When manufacturing using the shaper cutter, Equation (3.3/5) applies to the form diameter. Equation (3.2/2) or (3.2/3) can also be used provided that the tool data is used in the equation in each case and that d Ff = dNf is written.

Investigations into the interference in the case of external gearings have been undertaken for | i| = 1 by Erney  and Scieniczei  [3/6], [3/7]. In this process, the interference limits present for large magnitudes | x 1 + x2| are expressed by the operating pressure angle for a uniform division of the total profile shift. For an “overhung” mounted pinion (e.g., a central pinion in conjunction with planetary gears), it is necessary to take into consideration that – for a short time at least while starting up – the backlash may be entirely used up (Figure 3.2/7), because the pinion tooth will drop into the gap of the counter gear teeth by its own weight.",

      "full_paragraph": "Another simplification is to neglect the load-dependency of the gearing stiffness. The reasons for load dependency are the existence of off-line-of-action tip contact, which leads to an enlargement of the contact ratio and whose size is dependent on the load, and the load-dependent stiffness part, which is produced by Hertzian deflection. If one assumes that the load fluctuations resulting from the vibrations are relatively minor compared to the nominal load (the aim in the design of the gear transmissions), then the path of stiffness ascertained for the nominal load can be used as a load-independent quantity in the calculation. Moreover, in view of the difficulties involved in determining the damping’s dependency on the rotating angle (refer to Section 6.3.4.4), only a mean damping constant is factored into the calculation. The differential equation system (6.3/35) now takes shape as follows: () () (),, Mq Dq C t q r t p t q q h++ = + +   (6.3/36) For a further simplification one disregards the non-linearities ()q q t p, ,. These are produced especially when the backlash of the tooth and roller bearing clearance take effect, when the static pre-load that exists is cancelled out due to the vibrations. That only happens in cases of very large vibration amplitudes, which should be avoided in applications in practice. That is why a linearisation by a deletion of the vector ()q q t p, , in Equation (6.3/35) or Equation (6.3/36) is permissible for a practical calculation in the area of uninterrupted flank contact. The linearised model (Figure 6.3/11) only loses its validity if K v exceeds the value 2.0 (in direct vicinity of resonance).",

Registering the static behaviour provides initial information about the strain on the individual coupling elements and possible weaknesses in the construction. Here the static position vector q0 marks the operating point in the vicinity of which the vibrations occur and is determined by m0Cq h = (6.3/47) The aim of the second step is to determine the resonance speed regions in order to make assertions about the anticipated additional loads already, without yet having carried out the subsequent vibration calculations. Put simply, with knowledge of the significant resonant frequencies, it is also possible to conduct the calculation of the additional loads in accordance with Section 6.3.4.8, whereby, however, major differences from the additional loads which actually exist must be allowed for. The resonant frequencies are determined with the help of Equation (6.3/48): ()2 i imȦ 0 CM v−=  (6.3/48) In the actual vibration calculations, for a nominal rotational speed the course of the additional dynamic loads over a vibration period and the maximum value of the additional load in this vibration period are determined. With these maximum amplitudes it is then possible to create the speed-dependent tooth load trace (as in Figure 6.3/6, for example), whose value is produced at the end of the tooth load calculation. Finally, for a speed in question, the ratio of the maximum tooth load to the mean tooth load effective during a vibration period is stated as the dynamic factor K v. Analytically, the equation system of motion Equation (6.3/36) is not solvable in closed form. Two ways to find the solution are numerical simulation methods or partial analytical approximation methods. Numerical simulation methods enable the exact acquisition of the parameters for the respective vibration status, such as the stiffness changes in the case of separating flanks or the resulting tooth system deviations. In the numerical simulation, Equation (6.3/35) is converted into a corresponding equation of state xAx b=+  (6.3/49) with the state vector q xq= (6.3/50) whose solution is calculated with numerical integration methods. The approximation methods determine the rotating angle or time-dependent model parameters only approximately in the form of a Fourier series with a low number of harmonics. A Fourier series approach is also used for the solution components of q. As such, usually only linearised models (without backlash of the tooth) can be calculated. Compared to numerical integration, often clear benefits in terms of calculation time can be achieved, with sufficient precision, nonetheless. The following are used as approximation methods:",

      "full_paragraph": "• calculation based on perturbations, • methods of the slowly fluctuating phase and amplitude, • approach with infinite Fourier series, • successive approximation with integral-differential equations. Applying approximation methods to complicated structures and non-linear models demands a major effort of analytical incisiveness and preparation of the equation system. The methods of integral-differential equations have already been applied to the complicated structure of planetary gear transmissions by Hortel  [6.3/10], for example. For complex models and the standardised depiction of coupled mechanical and electrical assemblies, and for determining control and regulation systems, multi-body simulation lends itself well and is described in Appendix 5. 6.3.4.6 Special Features of Vibration Behaviour Non-linear vibration behaviour At this point, only the influence of the “major” non-linearities owing to the existing tooth back- lash and bearing clearances are to be explained. Minor non-linearities of the stiffness of a tooth pair, which is to a small extent load dependent, and the non-linearity due to the load-dependent size of the off-line-of-action tip contact remain disregarded because they have no significant influence on the vibration behaviour. As far as the stiffness values are determined for the nominal load (= operating point), then this load influence has been sufficiently registered. In contrast, the effective stiffness of the gearing sinks abruptly to the value zero if the tooth backlash takes effect in the case of flank separation under load. Only when the loaded flanks come into contact again or the non-working flanks impact one another will the gearing stiffness take effect again. For the vibration process this means that in the gearing in the state of separated flanks there are no reactive loads in effect anymore, and with that no acceleration loads are caused through the deformation of the tooth stiffness. In cases of strong vibrations, where tooth backlash takes effect, gear transmissions with backlash would not exhibit such large vibration amplitudes as gear transmissions without backlash. In the tooth load trace over speed, the influence of tooth backlash makes itself evident in a decrease in resonance amplitudes (from roughly K v > 2.0) and a drop in the resonance curve towards lower speeds. This decrease can be plausibly explained by the fact that with backlash in effect, the mean value of the gearing stiffness in effect during a mesh period, and thus also the natural frequency of the resonance, decreases. The resonance shifts to lower speeds, and does this even more so the longer the backlash is in effect during a mesh period. However, this drop in the resonance curve brings with it the creation of unstable areas in this curve, in which the amplitude can jump. As such, different tooth load traces can occur when the resonance point is crossed with rising or falling speeds. At an increasing speed the abrupt change from the lower resonance curve segment to the upper only takes place at a higher speed than the jump from the upper to the lower resonance curve segment at a decreasing speed. Figure 6.3/16 shows a measured tooth load trace over speed, with the influence of the tooth backlash clearly evident (gear transmission rattling, refer to [6.3/11]). The processes actually taking place when tooth backlash takes effect can only be precisely registered if not only the non-linear spring characteristic curve is taken into account, but also when impact effects that occur when the tooth flanks strike are included. Especially in the case of the so-called “rattling” of unloaded gears that are also running in car shift gearboxes, the impact impulses must be taken into account because deformations of the gearing hardly occur, and only the application of impact theory can lead to solving the vibration problem [6.3/11], [6.3/19], [6.3/20].",

The appearance of high-level wear  below a rolling speed of v = 0.5 m/s is typical in cases of hardened and quenched and tempered gears. The pairing of hard and soft results in high wear values. Further works based on Plewe are aimed at ascertaining local wear and at internal gearing (Schudy, J.:  “Tests on flank load-bearing capacity of external and internal gearing” (draft) Dissertation TU Munich 2010). In connection with attempts to further penetrate the wear problem theoretically, the name Dierich [6.5/87] should be mentioned, who modelled the surface as a stochastic process field. This was the basis on which Voßiek developed further approaches for the theory of wear forecasting among gear pairs [6.5/88]. Abrasive wear due to impurities in oils was studied by Stoew  [6.5/85]. For the range studies (v w = 4 to 13 m/s; ıH = 150 to 650 N/mm2, C45 quenched and tempered) a dependency on sliding path could be found, but none on sliding speed. With the number of cycles of rolling and the load, the wear increased arithmetically. Permissible wear  is to be determined according to multiple criteria. These include • Minimum breakage safety of tooth root (reduction of tooth thickness) • Maximum permissible quantity of abrasion in the lubricant • Pointing of the teeth or minimum tooth tip thickness • Weakening of the case hardness • Maximum backlash • Deterioration of the tooth form among gears which occasionally run quickly (maximum permissible helix form deviation decisive, increase in dynamic load and noise)",

For high-speed gear drives (turbo drives), the major part of the total loss consists of idling losses. Experimental investigations to determine the idling losses of injection-lubricated cylindrical gears at circumferential speed up to 200 m/s were carried out by Maurer [6.6/44]. The subject matter of this research consisted of ventilation losses, which form the major part of the idling losses, and hydraulic losses. The ventilation losses are primarily influenced by the gearing parameters of face width and module. Empirical equations and theoretical similarity approaches have been deduced to calculate the ventilation loss torque. The ventilation losses have a significant influence for circumferential speed v > 50 m/s. These losses can be clearly reduced by gear boxes vacuumed or filled with thin air or gases with low density (e.g., helium; see patent WO 1996015392 A1).",

The terms for the deviations of single gears and gear pairs, as well as the allowable values for the accuracy and backlash allowance parameters, are defined in standards. Specifications in accordance with ISO 1328 [8/18], [8/19] and informative amendments in ISO TR 10064 Part 1 to 5 [8/20] to [8/24] apply internationally. In Germany, the key terms were defined in DIN 3960 [8/1], the tolerance system in DIN 3961 [8/2], DIN 3962 [8/3] to [8/5], DIN 3963 [8/6] and DIN 3964 [8/7] and the system of fits in DIN 3967 [8/8]. A further revision of the standards will take place continuously in the coming years and will gradually lead to the standardisation of specifications. The international standard ISO 21771 [8/10] in the German version DIN ISO 21771 [8/11] and the national amendment DIN 21772 [8/12] are a basis for further development. The essential difference in the calculations is that, when using the equations in accordance with DIN ISO 21771, all geometric variables have a positive result, even with internal gearing (despite the negative number of teeth, which remains as an identifying feature), whereas, when using the equations in accordance with DIN 3960 for internal gearing, the negative number of teeth produces negative geometric parameters (diameter, pitch angle, tooth thickness angle, tooth space angle and centre distances). This negative sign does not mean that it is not a matter of real variables. In order to ensure the consistency of the calculations throughout the book, the new definitions and equations according to ISO 21171 have also been dispensed with in Section 8. Therefore, in the case of internal gearing, absolute values must be used as a basis for the testing (calculation of actual properties and comparison with the target properties). The revision of ISO 1328 in light of the AGMA specifications, e.g., [8/33], [8/34], [8/35] and [8/36], represents a possible basis for the unification of the allowable deviations and tolerances. From the standpoint of measurement implementation, the above-mentioned standards are supplemented by VDI/VDE guidelines [8/26] to [8/32]. 8.1.2 Tolerance System The accuracy grades of ISO and DIN gear tooth tolerance system correlate to the manufacturing costs for the individual types of deviation. They contain 12 grades of accuracy, where accuracy grade 1 is assigned to the smallest and accuracy grade 12 to the largest allowable deviations [8/2].",

      "full_paragraph": "The specification of test parameters and the grade of accuracy is usually carried out empirically on the basis of many years of experience. In order to facilitate the tolerance specifications, functional groups  for specific operating characteristics and requirements are defined in DIN 3961: • uniformity of the transmission of motion ( G), • quiet running and dynamic load capacity ( L), • static load capacity (load distribution) ( T) and • no indication of the function ( N). For each functional group (G, L, T, N) three test groups  (A, B, C) are defined (Table 8/1). These test groups contain up to 3 measurement quantities, which are suitable to evaluate in order to qualify gears regarding their accuracy grades.  For example, testing of the pitch deviations, the transverse profile deviations and the flank line deviations is recommended for the functional group L (quiet running and dynamic load capacity) in the test group A for the accuracy grade 6. It is also possible to assign two or more functional groups of a different accuracy grade to one gear. This is referred to as tolerance families . Example: G 8, L 7 means: specification factors for uniformity of the transmission of motion ( G) in accuracy 8, specification factors for the quiet running ( L) in accuracy 7. In many cases no functional group is assigned in the tolerance indication. Then, the specifications of the manufacturer, the requirements of the client or jointly reached agreements apply to the testing. The specification of tolerances or grades of accuracy is increasingly carried out for heavily loaded gears according to dynamic calculations, calculations for load capacity and running uniformity on the basis of numerical analysis methods. The types of deviation to be tested (tolerances) should be defined in accordance with the information contained in each measurement quantity, the manufacturing conditions, the operating conditions, and possibly taking into account statistical analyses. 8.1.3 Gear: System of Fits The system of fits includes the relationships between backlash and toleranced fit sizes. To ensure the desired backlash between two meshing gears, reductions in the tooth thicknesses of both gears compared to the nominal tooth thicknesses are required. In DIN 3967 [8/8], tables are shown with recommended values for upper limit devi-ations E sns and tolerances Tsn of the normal tooth thickness. This results in the lower limit deviations E sni (Figure 8/1). It should be noted that, in practice, further influence quantities (e.g., centre distance, axis position deviations, tooth system deviations, as well as heating and the elastic effects of the load) influence the backlash too.

Under the influence of a force acting in the direction of the centre dis-tance, at least one left and one right flank of the gears are always engaged simultaneously (two-flank engagement); refer to Fig-ure 8/63. The self-adjusting centre distance in the double-flank roll test is denoted by a L. The radial composite deviation  Fi޵ is the variation of the centre distance of double-flank compos- ite testing within one revolution of the test object. The tooth to tooth radial composite deviation fi޵ is the biggest difference of the centre distance of double-flank composite testing within a rotating angle corresponding to one mesh.

      "full_paragraph": "The choice of the measuring conditions (e.g., cutoff wavelength, tracing length, probe ball ra- dius, measuring point distance) must be made according to [8/15] and [8/17]. If there is insuffi-cient measuring distance or the measuring range of the probe is too small, the number and not the length of individual measurement distances (the cutoff wavelength) must always be reduced. The altered conditions must be pointed out in the results . Alternatively, but with greater uncer- tainty, the roughness can be determined by means of a mould. 8.8 Noise Noise analyses are recognised as test methods that complement the manufacturing process and conclude the manufacturing of a transmission. A distinction is made between the structure-borne sound and airborne sound test. The structure-borne noise test supports the error diagnosis objectively. In an acoustically defined e nvironment (sound booth), no ticeable noise can be identified with the often subjective airborne sound evaluation and, thus, complaints about noise can be avoided. Both complement each other. Microphones and vibration sensors or laser Doppler vibrometers are used in the detection of signals. Single gears meshing with specially selected gears or master gears, individual sets of gears or manufactured transmissions can be tested. The recording of speed and the associated noise, if necessary for all gears of the transmission, supports the subsequent analysis. Final conclusions are possible only with real operating and environmental conditions. In a subjective test, the experience of the tester has to be relied upon. In an objective test, signals can undergo a frequency analysis (FFT), among other things, so as to separate single components and assign possible causes. Special versions of representation, such as frequency spectra recorded depending on the speed (Campbell diagram), are also helpful in the evaluation [8/52], [8/68]. 8.9 Use of Spline Gauges The determination of the described quality and backlash allowance parameters is insufficient particularly in the evaluation of splines. Their function (fitting behaviour) can be tested only through the use of gauges. There are toothed ri ng gauges and mandrel gauges for this purpose. Because gauges allow only yes/no decisions, no direct conclusions can be drawn about manu-facturing deviations from their application. 8.10 Symbols and Symbol Explanations a mm centre distance, amplitude aL mm centre distance for double-flank engagement b mm tooth face width bM mm contact line overlap (for measuring base tangent length) bT mm width of contact pattern CHĮ m amount of transverse profile slope modification CHȕ m amount of flank line slope modification CĮ m amount of profile crowning (barrelling)  CĮa m amount of tip relief CĮf m amount of root relief Cȕ m amount of flank line crowning CȕI,II m amount of end relief d mm reference diameter da mm tip diameter db mm base diameter df mm root diameter dFa mm tip form diameter dFf mm root form diameter dK mm diameter of circle through centre of ball dM mm diameter of measuring circle",

      "full_paragraph": "- Hard shaving with galvanically bonded CBN roll-honing disc, in analogy to diagonal shaving with additional guide gear set • Internally toothed roll-honing disc - Ring-honing method with resin or galvanically bonded roll-honing disc, with or without rolling coupling. Corundum, CBN and diamond are used as the abrasive material with resin and ceramic binding. Refer to Appendix 15.5. Since, in analogy to roll shaving, the principles of multiple flank contact apply, which means that in order to achieve the best possible final accuracy a transverse contact ratio of İ Į = 2 and a large contact area between the workpiece and the tool should be strived for, roll-honing with an internally toothed  honing wheel  represents a preferred solution. In analogy to roll shaving, the chip removal is done on arc-shaped contact paths along the flanks. This results in cutting speeds which, compared to typical honing methods, are relatively high, so in this respect roll-honing methods are also known for their relatively high productivity. Touch  honing  (predominantly ground gearing) works with a resin-bonded honing wheel with an abrasive grinding material (corundum), which is dressed and sharpened using a diamond dressing wheel. There are different variations of this method (diagonal, transverse and plunge roll-honing, in analogy to the roll-shaving methods) which can be applied, depending on which flank areas should (preferably) be processed. In general, the amount removed on the flanks is less than 0.005 to 0.008 mm, which particularly means that form deviations and roughness are reduced. The final level of accuracy is strongly dependent on the accuracy of the pre-machining. The surface quality that can be achieved is R a = 0.1 to 0.2 m. Super shaving  represents the implementation of diagonal soft shaving in a hard-machining process; the shaving cutter was replaced by a CBN-coated honing wheel (a single-layer CBN coating galvanically applied to a cylindrical gear as basic body), which acts like a shaving cutter without rolling coupling in double-flank contact on the hardened workpiece and, as such, reduces in particular the deviations arising from case hardening and pre-machining. As far as the achievable accuracy goes, the principles of roll shaving apply. For super shaving, the main parameters affecting the achievable accuracy are the runout and axial runout behaviour of the cylindrical gears after case hardening. Since the exact pitch of the tool can only form in the overlap area, because of the free running between workpiece and tool, runout deviations falsify the cumulative pitch of the workpiece. Wobbling leads to wobbling profile lines and tooth traces since the cylinders which are effective in generation are not identical to the measuring cylinders and planes of measurement. The amount removed from the flanks is 0.015 to 0.020 mm, and the achievable surface quality R a = 0.2 to 0.4 m. Presently, super shaving has been forced out of the market by generating grinding or honing with an internally toothed tool. Just as with super shaving, hard shaving works preferably with a CBN-coated externally toothed honing wheel, which, however, is roll coupled to the workpiece by a guiding pair of discs affixed to the same shafts as the tool and workpiece. Aside from a CBN-coated honing wheel, it is also possible to use a ceramically bonded corundum wheel. To realise the infeed of the hone, the backlash of the guiding pair of discs can be exploited. However, with that, in hard shaving the contact between the tool and the workpiece is single-flank, which means that the two different tooth flanks must be machined one after the other. In the case of the CBN-coated honing wheel, it is possible to efficiently achieve removal of up to 0.15 mm from the flanks, whereby enforced kinematic motion also produces an improvement to the geometric accuracy of the toothing. With hard shaving it is possible to achieve an accuracy of up to ISO 1328 (DIN 3962/63) quality 5, along with a surface quality of R a < 1.25 m. With that, this honing me thod should be  an alternative for tooth grinding in some cases, even without having achieved the high grinding qualities, however. As such, hard shaving currently has no relevance on the market.",
